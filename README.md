##This is a Quora login page

with explaintion on how i accomplished this work.
In this work i used plain HTML&CSS ,

1.I created html skelton and linked a saparte stylesheet ,which i used to apply all the css work on the html page and also linked a reset sheet.
2. I created two headers in the body element , positioned the headers in there respactive place with the right font size.
3.I created a login Form , that acceptes Email and password additionally a forgot password link below the password input section and a login button. 
4. I added a navigation bar below the login form containing the About ,Careers ,Privacy ,Sitemap ,Terms ,Contact

NB. 
 regarding html&css i work at both files at the same time , in another words everytime i complete an html elelment i complete it in css as well, this way i can elemnate error of any type before moving on .
 
 I used shapes to align the content in the right place
